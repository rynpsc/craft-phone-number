## Twig Filter

This plugin also adds a `tel` Twig filter for extracting phone numbers from a string and auto linking them using the rfc3966 format.

```twig
{{ entry.text|tel }}
```

By default only numbers entered in international format will be formatted. To format local number i.e. those without a region code such as +44, you can pass in a default country code to use when parsing.

```twig
{{ entry.text|tel('GB') }}
```
